## We have two strategies:
### - Moving Average (basic exponential moving average with stop loss)
### - One trade (does one trade)
They're both in directories named after their names.

To run you'll need a couple environment variables:
```
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=<your key>
LICENSE_KEY=ENCODECLUB_DOJO_LICENSE_OCTOBER_2024
```

please remove .python-version if it interferes with running the strategy.
